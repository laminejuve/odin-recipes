    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1
            <p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 2
            <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water,
                 stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 3
            <p>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat.
                 Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly,
                  5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.
                 Transfer to a bowl and mix spaghetti sauce into ground beef.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 4
           <p>Place half the slices of butter into the bottom of a 9x13-inch casserole dish.
                Spread half the spaghetti into the dish. Mix cottage cheese,
                cream cheese, and sour cream together in a bowl; spread mixture over spaghetti.
                Layer remaining spaghetti over creamy mixture. Top with remaining pats of butter.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 5
           <p>Pour ground beef mixture over spaghetti and spread to cover casserole.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 6
            <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes.
                 Spread Cheddar cheese over casserole and continue baking until cheese
                  has melted and is lightly browned, about 15 more minutes.</p>
